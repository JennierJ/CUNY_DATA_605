#### Using the "cars" dataset in R, build a linear model for stopping distance as a function of speed and replicate the analysis of your textbook chapter 3 (visualization, quality evaluation of the model, and residual analysis.)

##### Take a look at dataset
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
head(cars)
```
##### Visualize the data
```{r cars}
plot(cars, xlab = "Speed (mph)", ylab = "Stopping distance (ft)",
     las = 1, xlim = c(0, 25))
```

##### The Linear Model Fuction
```{r }
attach(cars)
liner <- lm(dist ~ speed)

liner
```
##### Evaluate the quality of the model
```{r}
summary(liner)
```
##### Resudual Analysis
```{r analysis}
plot(fitted(liner), resid(liner))
qqnorm(resid(liner))
qqline(resid(liner))
```
